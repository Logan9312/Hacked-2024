# App Info
- Simple React Native app created to help roomates manage living together, and reduce issues with coordinating turns for household duties.
- I used the Chai stack for this project, which helped me avoid dependency hell trying to setup the project: https://github.com/AviAvinav/chai.
- The backend for the app was developed using Go and can be found here: https://github.com/Logan9312/Hacked-2024-Backend
# Features
- Create payment intents and invoice each other for rent payments, or other charges like grocery bills.
